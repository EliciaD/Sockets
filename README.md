Sockets
=======

I hosted this project locally. To view install node in the terminal, open the folder, install gulp, and activate server.
node server.js and also open gulp watch if you are to edit.

I used jade. I used jade because it was recommended in class and it looked very clean. It is a very fast, sleek looking version of html.
